# Project Title

Holiday Playlist & Lyric Generator

## Description

-  An application that gives the user the ability to search for playlists based on a holiday. A playlist is displayed with an audio preview,
   as well as lyrics for the song.
-  Webpage was developed to enable the user easy access to Holiday themed music and lyrics.

## Usage

-  Select a holiday from the dropdown menu and the playlist will be instantly displayed. Each song is displayed with a media player that
   gives a 30 second preview (given the audio is available through the API). The lyrics will be displayed by click event, if lyrics cannot
   be found through the API a message will be displayed instead of lyrics. After each playlist is generated, a favorites section below the
   dropdown menu will save the three most recent 'favorited' songs so the user can reference to it.
